Legend has it that a famous Christian prophet, John the Baptist, was imprisoned <br>here and beheaded. So many Christians believe he was buried in Sebastia, and two <br>churches were built in his honor, making it a sacred place of worship for Christians.<br> Sebastia is a land with a long history and there are many valuable heritage sites and <br>traditional cultures. However, these cultures have been controlled and distorted by<br> occupation and war. The Israeli government has made several attempts to occupy and destroy <br>this history and culture to expel the Palestinian residents of this land. Israel has banned <br>Palestinian access to the Sebastia archaeological sites and has attacked the Sebastia sites on<br> several occasions.<br> This project documents and preserve the culture and the people&#39;s memory of Sebastia. When <br>civilisation is controlled and history is occupied, the people&#39;s memory of the land becomes <br>the best evidence and the most valuable civilisation. </div><div class="introduction-title">SOUND ARCHIVE</div><div class="introduction-content"> Sound is a very powerful presence. When there is a wall in front of us, we cannot see or touch <br>the other side of the wall, but we can hear the sound coming from the other side. When we <br>close our eyes and don&#39;t look at what is in front of us, sound can still be transmitted into the <br>brain through vibrations. Through sound, we can break through distance and space to experience <br>the culture of Sebastia, the memory of its people, and their situation under occupation and <br>destruction. <br>History cannot be transmitted without sight and sound. While artifacts and written records can be <br>looted and destroyed, the history that exists in the minds of the current generation will still be <br>transmitted through their oral voices. The sound archive will combine the visual and the auditory <br>in an audio visualisation on the website. In the future, this sound archive will become a record <br>and evidence that will transcend time and space. </div><div class="introduction-title">NUMBER SCHEME</div><div class="introduction-content"> The sound files are named in the Number Scheme, which is a unique &#39;identity card&#39; for each <br>sound. Each library book is assigned a systematic accession code, depending on the category, <br>when it is entered into the library. This helps the books to be recorded and collected in an <br>orderly and clear manner. Every army, every tank, every gun, even every soldier, is assigned a <br>code number. This number records their existence and the fact that they cannot be ignored, as <br>well as giving them aggression and offensiveness. And I think that there is also great power in <br>sound. These codes will record and collect them, but also prove their existence and give them <br>power. <br>(Numbering Format: Character + Background + Content) </div><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/superBoyXdy/gmximage/master/numberimg.png" class="introduction-image" alt=""></div>',2),o=[r],u=t({__name:"introduction",setup(d){return e(!1),e([[1,2,3],[4,5,6,7,8],[9,10]]),e(),(c,h)=>(i(),a("div",s,o))}});export{u as default};
